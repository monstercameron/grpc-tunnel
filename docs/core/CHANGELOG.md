## [Unreleased]

### Commits

- `be70bef` ci: harden security and release workflow guards
- `430fe06` docs: add deep security fuzz release process
- `d39af64` fix: harden websocket read and error-channel concurrency
- `b37d222` feat: advance GoGRPCBridge dev-to-prod readiness
- `7206dd4` chore: group current submodule updates

### Changed

- Reorganized repository docs into `docs/core`, `docs/examples`, `docs/benchmarks`, and `docs/observability`, and updated `docs/catalog.json` + docs portal path resolution accordingly.
- Added root GitHub-facing wrapper files (`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `LICENSE`) that point to canonical docs under `docs/`.
- Removed stale `Makefile` references from docs and removed `Makefile` from the repository in favor of the Go runner workflow (`go run ./tools/runner.go ...`).
- Expanded ignore coverage for local benchmark and coverage artifacts (`coverage.txt`, `perf_*.out`, `benchmarks.test.exe`) and cleaned generated local artifacts.

## [v0.0.11] - 2026-03-27

### Highlights

- Canonical import path is aligned to `github.com/monstercameron/grpc-tunnel` across module metadata, examples, and documentation.
- Release and CI canonical publish checks enforce repository/module identity and clean-consumer `go get` validation for the canonical path.
- Release workflow canonical publish step now runs with `RUNNER_CANONICAL_GOPROXY=direct` to avoid proxy-index lag false negatives during first corrected-tag publication.
